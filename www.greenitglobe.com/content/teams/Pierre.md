## Pierre Van Hoorebeke

#### Chief Legal Officer

Pierre is responsible for all corporate, IP and commercial legal affairs at Green IT Globe. Pierre is also in charge of the legal department of Incubaid, focusing on mergers and acquisitions, and venture capital. Prior to joining Incubaid and Green IT Globe, Pierre was a corporate and M&A lawyer in top tier law firms (Laga and Baker & McKenzie (Brussels, Belgium)), providing distinctive legal advice to various leading international corporations. Pierre studied law at the Ghent University, Belgium and holds a master degree in European Law from the Brussels University (U.L.B.), Belgium. As mentioned before, Green IT Globe is born out of Incubaid, the Belgium based technology incubator founded by Kristof de Spiegeleer. Kristof and Incubaid have set up several technology companies in different time waves. The first wave of companies has all been acquired by now. The second wave of technology companies is reaching maturity, with already one successful exit. Green IT Globe is our 3e wave and aims to be the biggest and most ambiutous company created so far from out of Incubaid.

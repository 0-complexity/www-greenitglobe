### Key Items

* Simplicity
It is simple to manage, maintain and control. It has an intuitive admin console, offering extensive usage insights and
auditing tools. Managing full access workspaces was never this easy.
* Always on
We use the web. This means there is no client software installation, no maintenance
or no configuration. And it enables geolocalisation and superb video-viewing quality. 
This is how the connected generation wants to work: nimble, fast and easy.
* Safety first
The hypersecure desktop keeps everything safe where you want it: SSL-encrypted, password protected, 
controlled and auditable.
* Audit trail

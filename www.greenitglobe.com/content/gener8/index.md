### IT Building Blocks
Gener8 are building blocks to create IT infrastructure and raw capacity. Gener8-PB is your storage building block allowing you to build large digital archives. Gener8-HC is hyperconverged storage that includes high-performance compute capacity for production and application workloads.

### Gener8-PB
This building block generates 1.5 petabyte of storage in only 1 meter. This compares to capacity needed for 350,000 DVD movies, 500,000,000 high definition pictures and thousands of hours surveillance camera storage.
* Petabyte archive building block, no limits to scalability
* Power-friendly, comparable with energy for 2 toasters
* Self-healing and regenarating storage
* Simplified interfaces, standard fileserver
* Digital preservation is possible for 30+ years

#### Technical
* 1.5 PB
* NAS & SAN Interface
* 56 Gbit/sec ethernet
* 2.000 MB/sec ingest speed
* 1.000.000 IOPs (IO Operations Per Second)

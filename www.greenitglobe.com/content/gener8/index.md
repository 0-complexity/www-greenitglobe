### IT Building Blocks

Our racks instantly provide IT infrastructure produced as cloud units. Combining cloud units provide you with scale-out capacity for storage, compute and performance.

### Storage Units

We easily fit 4 petabyte of storage in a single rack. This compares to capacity needed for 350,000 DVD movies, 500,000,000 high definition pictures and thousands of hours surveillance camera storage.

* Petabyte archive building block, no limits to scalability
* Power-friendly, extreem low electrivity requirement
* Self-healing and regenarating storage
* Simplified interfaces, standard fileserver
* Digital preservation is possible for 30+ years

#### Technical

* 4 PB
* NAS & SAN Interface
* 56 Gbit/sec ethernet

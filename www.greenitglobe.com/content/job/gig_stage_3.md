### Project Overview / Tooling / Outcome
At Green IT Globe we are building out a grid of cloud capacity providers all over the world to bring the internet capacity closer and more uniform to the customer. To make it easier for the customer to start using our grid, we are making the deployment of popular open source software applications very easy through our homegrown python 3 based technologies JumpScale, AYS & the cockpit.

It will be your job to go to work in these technologies to make the installation and maintenance (eg creating backing at regular intervals) of the software completely automatic.

Things like deploying virtual machines, linux containers, working with storage appliances, bringing live peer to peer networks between the different datacenters you are deploying to, will become familiar to you.

You will be working in a very innovative environment where cutting edge technology is developed on a daily basis. On top of that you will be cooperating with top notch engineers.
The internship will take about 6 to 8 weeks, and can be determined in cooperation with us.

* Locatie: Lochristi, 10 minuten van Gent Dampoort
* Verwachte duur van de stage: 6-8 weken
* Stageplaats voor een student bij GIG
* Stuur CV naar [jobs@greenitglobe.com](mailto:jobs@greenitglobe.com)

### Project Overview / Tooling / Outcome
Atom is a text editor that is modern, approachable, yet hackable to the coreâ€” a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.

Atom is being developed by GitHub. More information on Atom can be found on [Atom](https://atom.io/). Rogerthat is a powerful secure messenger that can be dynamically extended with your own applications. More information on Rogerthat can be found on [Rogerthat](http://www.rogerthat.net/).

Using a Rogerthat plugin for Atom we want to make the creation of extensions more development friendly, so that developers can focus on creating value rather than spending time on setting up their development environment.

As a developer you will be working with javascript, css and html, and integrating all of this in the Atom code editor. On top of that you also will be working on integrating with online tools like GitHub, Google App Engine and its opensource variant AppScale for the hosting of the created Rogerthat extensions.

You will be working in a very innovative environment where cutting edge technology is developed on a daily basis. On top of that you will be cooperating with top notch engineers.

The internship will take about 6 to 8 weeks, and can be determined in cooperation with us.

### Project Overview / Tooling / Outcome
When creating and maintaining api's, there are two approaches:
* Design first
* You design the api, all methods, descriptions and types from the api point of view. Afterwards, you generate all the boilerplate code and documentation to bootstrap the code.
* Code first
* When modifying the implementation, the interface definitions need to be kept in sync. Besides the good practice of keeping your specification up to date, it is used by other tools to generate clients, documentation, ...

GIG created an open source project [Go-RAML](https://github.com/Jumpscale/go-raml) in Go that uses [RAML 1.0](http://raml.org/) as the specification format. It currently has these features:

* Generate server stub in Go, Python, and Nim from a raml file.
* Generate complete client library in Go, Python, and Nim from an RAML file.
* Generate [capnp](https://capnproto.org/) schema. See [capnp docs](https://github.com/Jumpscale/go-raml/blob/master/docs/capnp.md) for details.

The code first approach is not implemented or designed yet and this is where you come in. You can contribute to an open source project and will be working in a very innovative environment where cutting edge technology is developed on a daily basis.

The internship will take about 4 weeks, and can be determined in cooperation with us.

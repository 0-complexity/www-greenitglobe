* Locatie: Lochristi, 10 minuten van Gent Dampoort
* Verwachte duur van de stage: 6-8 weken
* Stageplaats voor een student bij GIG
* Stuur CV naar [jobs@greenitglobe.com](mailto:jobs@greenitglobe.com)

### Project Overview / Tooling / Outcome
Electron, a toolkit developed by GitHub, allows building cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you can build a website, you can build a desktop app.

Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It takes care of the hard parts so you can focus on the core of your application. Popular editors such as Atom (by GitHub) and Visual Studio Code (by Microsoft) are also created with Electron. Also the popular team collaboration product Slack is developed using Electron.

More information on Electron can be found here: [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)

GIG wants to use this technology to build a desktop client for our Rogerthat messenger product (think WhatsApp, but then specific for organisations). More information about Rogerthat can be found on [Rogerthat](http://www.rogerthat.net). Rogerthat is being used by more than a million people today.

You will be working in a very innovative environment where cutting edge technology is developed on a daily basis. On top of that you will be cooperating with top notch engineers.

The internship will take about 6 to 8 weeks, and can be determined in cooperation with us.

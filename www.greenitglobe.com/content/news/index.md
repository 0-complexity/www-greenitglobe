Over the last 30+ years, IT evolved by adding and integrating thousands of independent IT components, dedicated servers, storage systems and networking hardware. This approach created very complex infrastructure that is costly to maintain.

Also due to the interdependence of these layers, innovators adopted a “painkiller” approach - resolving issues layer by layer, rather than risk upsetting the system by replacing or removing legacy components.

Green IT Globe took a radically different approach - we started with a blank sheet of paper and created a holistic technology solution.  This approach gave us the freedom to remove layers and build our racks as we wanted, using the best technology available to us - without trying to preserve legacy components.

Our racks are different from existing cloud technology - in particular our systems are:

- Local.  We deploy our Gener8 systems to the edge of the network - close to our users.
- Modular.  We can scale quickly to handle any large (or small) customer requirements.  
- Simple. We employ a thin layer close to the base metal that interfaces with any application or workloads
- Less hardware. Fewer discs enabling much lower power consumption and waste
- Less people. Self healing automation and intelligence - removing huge costs and vulnerability 
- End-to-End integrity. All software is owned or optimized to integrate with our hardware and maximise reliability

The result is a dramatically improved efficiency and performance for our racks versus existing systems.  Our racks produce much greater capacity - at much lower cost - than other cloud technology.  Also our racks require 1/10th the power of existing hyperscale and other solutions.

### The Internet has a problem. 

Demand for IT capacity is far outstripping the available cloud capacity due to new applications like Big Data, IoT and Artificial Intelligence. The existing hyperscale cloud architecture can not cope with this outsize demand as the requirements for land, power and funding are just too great.

Going forward, we believe our hyper-distributed architecture is the right approach for IT. Edge networks like ours will not necessarily replace the existing hyperscale capacity powering today’s cloud - rather, edge networks will scale to meet the increased capacity demands going forward.

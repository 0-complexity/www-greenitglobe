disc = "Today, hyperconverged infrastructure solutions natively collapse core storage, computing, and storage networking functions into a single software solution or appliance. The hyperconverged appliance thus comprises of a distributed software stack, which runs on a single or multiple server nodes that constitute a cluster. No more integration work needs to be done, no more maintenance on seperated technologies and functions like compute, storage and networking.  Your IT resources are freed up to condifer and plan how IT can be a business enabler and not just a necessity.  The lower TCO does not come forward in actual money spend but also through benefits and focus of the people involved."

### Server virtualization!

* Collapsed technology layers.
Hyper converged is all about eliminating layers of communciation and integration between computer, storage and networking
resources.  Eliminating layers means eliminating overhead and complexity which leads to less integration work, less components
needed and less technology licenses required to operated the solution.

* Self healing and 0-touch maintenance.
All hardware required to operated the solution is standard x86 bare metal hardware.  When hardware breaks the intelligent
software will detect this and rendors the compute of storage component / node as defective.  The software will re-organise the
workload to no longer include the defective node of component.  We recommend not to replace the defective components but to 
cater for additional capacity to account for the loss of capacaity due to this defective node and for busienss as asual 
capacity growth.  This minimises the risk of operational staff mistakingly taking part of the infrastucture offline and risking
damage to or loss of data by human error.

* Automation and analytics.
As all of the intelligence is delivered by software a very high percentage of repetitive and maintenance tasks can be automated 
in the software.  This frees up resources in the IT department to be involved in projects that present creative support and 
innovation to the rest of the business, helping the business in general to achieve it's targets.

* Intelligent software, not hardware.
The intelligence of our sollutions is embedded in the software that runs on bare metal, standard x86 hardware.  No specific
hardware and accelarators are requires for the solution to run which brings enormous cost savings.  Compared to some components
vendors this makes a huge difference in investments and operational costs.

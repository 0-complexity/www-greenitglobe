### Security!

* Simplicity instead if complexity.
Selecting, procuring, deploying and operating IT infrastructure is a complicated and time consuming activity which requires
experts in a number of different technologies.  All this needs to be done in a well coordinated way to secure the information
contained within the solution.  Complexity is to be avoided when security matters.  Therefore a simpel, collapsed solution with
less integration work and layers involved allows for better security.

* Silo'd approach
Non converged IT solution are build by integrating different technologies, point solutions, from different vendors creating
a silo'd approach for a specific solution.  The silo'd approach causes the security to be suboptimal because it has to take many
different factors into account.

* Innovation instead of operation
Complicated solution setups require complicated security processes and policies.  These often cause a business to loose
creativity and flexibility supporting business innovation and progress.  By simplyfying the technology setup the security
requirements simplify substancially allowing for more time and effort to be spend on innovation and supporting the business.

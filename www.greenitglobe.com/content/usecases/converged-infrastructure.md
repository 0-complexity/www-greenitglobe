disc = "Gartner defines Hyper Converged Infrastructure Solutions (HCIS) encompasses software-centric architectures that integrate  compute, storage and networking on commodity hardware. This represents a cost-effective,  well-architected infrastructure solution that is simple to deploy, manage and scale that also consumes the fewest technical resources possible. HCIS solutions are built and delivered as a preconfigured appliance, are sold with provisioning and management software, and include vendor support. A key challenge for IT departments is  that Infrastructure complexity and maintenance continue to negatively impact the agility of organisations to adopt new ways of delivering IT:  Hyper Converged Infrastructure solutions.  Highly virtualized midsize enterprises with fewer than 200 virtual machines should opt for hyperconverged infrastructure."

            <p class="p-lg">Green IT Gateway’s vision is to deliver IT in a green, secure and pay-as-you-use method, similar to the way we currently consume electricity! The Green IT Gateway technology ecosystem is the first credible platform that can make this vision a reality.
    
Green IT Gateway`s founders see a need to perceive IT in another way, a mind change in how companies are dealing with IT today. IT has become the most important element next to electricity and oil in our economy, since it helps us humans to make our lives easier, better organised and more efficient.
Green IT Gateway is not just another marketing slogan. It is a brand of Incubaid , an international cloud solutions incubator with headquarters in Ghent, Belgium that aims to change the way we all use IT in our daily lives. This is done by bringing innovative cloud computing solutions that make a difference compared to traditional cloud solutions.
The Green IT Gateway ecosystem brings together a diverse yet complementary IT stack that offers more reliability, faster performance and more energy efficiency than any other technology group. Through Green IT Gateway, organisations can benefit from the industry’s lowest total cost of ownership for the delivery of cloud computing. <br>
